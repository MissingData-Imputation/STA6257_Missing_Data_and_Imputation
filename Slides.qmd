## What is Missing Data?

- Missing data occurs when there are missing values in a dataset

- Missing data is classified into 3 different categories:
    - Missing Completely At Random (MCAR)
    - Missig At Random (MAR)
    - Missing Not At Random (MNAR)

## Methods to Handle Missing Data

- There are an array of methods to handle missing data, some methods include:
  
  - The Likelihood Bayesian method - predicts what the values of the missing data can by treating missing values as unobserved random variables that have a distribution based on prevvious observed data. This method involves immense immense knowledge and skill of both statistics and technical coding.
 
  - The weightinig method - inolves weight subjects who are included in the analysis to compensate for those who were excluded because of missing values.
