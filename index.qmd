## Introduction

#### What is missing data?

Missing data occurs when there are missing values in a dataset. There
are many reasons why this occurs. It can be intentional or unintentional
and can be classified into the following three categories, otherwise
known as missingness mechanisms [@mai2023]:

-   Missing completely at random (MCAR) is the probability of missing
    data being completely independent of any other variables.

-   Missing at random (MAR) is the probability of missing data being
    related to the observed values.

-   Missing not at random (MNAR) is the probability of missing data
    being dependent on the missing and observed values.

(X are completely observed values. Y are partly missing variables. Z is
the component of the cause of missingness unrelated to X and Y. R is the
missingness.)

These categories are important in determining how to handle the missing
data. The problem with just ignoring any missing values is that it does
not give a true representation of the dataset and can lead to bias when
analyzing. This reduces the statistical power of the analysis
[@van2020]. To enhance the quality of the research, the following should
be followed: explicitly acknowledge missing data problems and the
conditions under which they occur and employ principled methods to
handle the missing data [@don2013]. There are two ways to deal with
missing values: delete or impute.

#### Deleting missing data

Listwise deletion is when the entire observation is removed from the
dataset. Deleting missing data can lead to the loss of important
information regarding your dataset and is therefore not recommended. In
certain cases, when the amount of missing data is small and the type is
MCAR, listwise deletion can be used. There usually won't be bias but
potentially important information may be lost.

T-tests and chi-square tests can be used to assess pairs of predictor
variables to determine whether the groups' means differ significantly.
If significant, the null hypothesis is rejected; therefore, indicating
that the missing values are not randomly scattered throughout the data
[@van2020]. This implies that the missing data is MAR or MNAR. If
nonsignificant, this implies that the data cannot be MAR (this does not
eliminate the possibility that it is not MNAR--other information about
the population is needed). Listwise deletion would be wasteful and
analysis biased if data is MAR or MNAR. Alternate methods of dealing
with the missing data is recommended: either pairwise deletion or
imputation.

Pairwise deletion is when only the missing variable of an observation is
removed. It allows more data to be analyzed than listwise deletion but
limits the ability to make inferences of the total sample. For this
reason, it is recommended to use imputation to properly deal with
missing data.

#### What is imputation?

Imputation is the method of replacing missing data with an estimate
obtained from the original, available data so there is a full data set
to analyze. To improve statistical power, the number of imputations
created should be at least equal to the percent of missing data (5%
equals 5 imputations, 10% equals 10 imputations, 20% equals 20
imputations, etc.) [@ped2017]. There are two types of imputation: single
and multiple.

#### Single Imputation

Single, or univariate, imputation is when only one estimate is used to
replace the missing data. Methods of single imputation include using the
mean, the last observation carried forward, and random imputation. The
following is a brief explanation of each:

-   Using the mean to replace a missing value is a straight-forward
    process. The mean of the dataset is calculated, including the
    missing value. The mean is then multiplied by the number of
    observations in the study. Next, the known values are subtracted
    from the product, and this gives an estimate that can be used for
    any missing values. The problem with this method is that it reduces
    the variance which leads to a smaller confidence interval.

-   Last Observation Carried Forward (LOCF) is a tehcnique of replacing
    a missing value in longitudinal studies with a previously observed
    value (the most recent value is carried forward) [@str2008]. The
    problem with this method is that it assumes that the previous
    observed value is perpetual when in reality that most likely is not
    the case.

-   Random imputation is a method of randomly drawing an observation and
    using that observation for any of the missing values. The problem
    with this method is that it introduces additional variability.

These single imputation methods are flawed. They often result in
underestimation of standard errors or too small p-values [@don2013],
which can cause bias in the analysis. Therefore, multiple imputation is
the better method because it handles missing data better and provides
less biased results.

#### Multiple Imputation

Multiple, or multivariate, imputation is when various estimates are used
to replace the missing data by creating multiple datasets from versions
of the original dataset. It can be done by using a regression model, or
a sequence of regression models, such as linear, logistic and Poison. A
set of *m* plausible values are generated for each unobserved data
point, resulting in *m* complete data sets [@don2013]. The new values
are randomly drawn from predictive distributions either through joint
modeling (JM, which is not used much anymore) or fully conditional
specification (FCS) [@won2023]. It is then analyzed and the results are
combined to obtain a single value for the missing data.

The purpose of multiple imputation is to create a pool of imputed data
for analysis, but if the pooled results are lacking, then multiple
imputation should not be done [@mai2023]. Another reason not to use
multiple imputation is if there are very few missing values; there may
be no benefit in using it. Also worth noting is some statistical
analyses software already have built-in features to deal with missing
data.

Multiple imputation by chained methods, otherwise known as MICE, is the
most common and preferred method of multiple imputation. For this
reason, the rest of this paper will focus on this method and variations
of it.

## Methods

Multiple imputation is an imputation method for missing data which
imputes the missing values with random values to generate m-amount of
datasets with complete cases.

For the purpose of this project, we uitilized Multiple Imputation (MI)
for the credit dataset (dataset consists of 14 variables: status, home,
time, age, marital, records, job, expenses, income, assets, debt,
amount, price).

In R which is a statistical programming software, we created 5 datasets
with imputed values using the MICE package (Multivariate Imputation by
Chained Equations) which can seamlessly impute missing values in a
dataset by looking at the data from other columns and estimate the best
prediction for each missing value.

Before imputing the missing data, it is important to check whether the
data has a linear relationship. Nonlinear data should be accounted for
in the analysis as well as the imputation process. Otherwise, an
incorrect statistical model will result. It is also important to check
for anomalies that may occur during imputation. Imputation models may
need to be adjusted if the imputed values fall outside the minimum and
maximum range of the observed values. More or fewer variables in the
imputation model may be needed for these types of anomalies.

The chained equation process can be broken down into four general steps:

Step 1: A simple imputation, such as imputing the mean, is performed for
every missing value in the dataset. These mean imputations can be
thought of as "place holders." Step 2: The "place holder" mean
imputations for one variable ("var") are set back to missing. Step 3:
The observed values from the variable "var" in Step 2 are regressed on
the other variables in the imputation model, which may or may not
consist of all of the variables in the dataset. In other words, "var" is
the dependent variable in a regression model and all the other variables
are independent variables in the regression model. These regression
models operate under the same assumptions that one would make when
performing linear, logistic, or Poison regression models outside of the
context of imputing missing data. Step 4: The missing values for "var"
are then replaced with predictions (imputations) from the regression
model. When "var" is subsequently used as an independent variable in the
regression models for other variables, both the observed and these
imputed values will be used. Step 5: Steps 2--4 are then repeated for
each variable that has missing data. The cycling through each of the
variables constitutes one iteration or "cycle." At the end of one cycle
all of the missing values have been replaced with predictions from
regressions that reflect the relationships observed in the data. Step 6:
Steps 2--4 are repeated for a number of cycles, with the imputations
being updated at each cycle.

##### Step 1

Evaluate data and select independent variables

##### Step 2

Create m sets of data from original dataset with missing values

##### Step 3

Perform analysis on each of the m sets

##### Step 4

Average the estimates across m estimates. Calculate the standard errors
and variance of m estimates. Combine using an adjustment term (1+1/m).

##### Details

The credit_data.csv file contains data of 4,454 subjects and stores a
combination of continuous, categorical and count values for 15
variables. Of the 15 variables, the "Status" variable contains binomial
categorical values of "good" and "bad" to describe the kind of credit
score each subject has.

```

It's a good idea to check distribution before and after imputation to
make sure the distribution doesn't change significantly.

```{r, warning=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
data <- credit[-c(1,4,7,8,9)]
summary(data)

md.pattern(data)

pMiss <- function(x){sum(is.na(x))/length(x)*100}
apply(data,2,pMiss)
# apply(data,1,pMiss)
```

The following variables are missing data:

Income NA's: 381/4454 = 8.6%

Assets NA's: 47/4454 = 1.1%

Debt NA's: 18/4454 = 0.4%

We need to determine the missingness mechanism for each. We can do this
in R using the mice package. There is a function that will help us
determine the pattern of missing data: md.pattern().

4,039 samples are complete

## Statistical Modeling

## Conclusion

In conclusion, missing data can occur in research for a variety of
reasons. It is never a good idea to ignore it. Doing this will lead to
biased estimates of parameters, loss of information, decreased
statistical power, and weak reliability of findings [@don2013]. The best
course of action is to impute the missing data by using multiple
imputation. When missing data is discovered, it is important to first
identify it and look for missing data patterns. Next, define the
variables in the dataset that are related to the missing values that
will be used for imputation. Create the necessary number of complete
data sets. Run the models and combine them using the imputed values, and
finally, analyze the complete dataset. Performing these steps will
minimize the adverse effects caused by missing data on the anaylsis
[@pam2016].
